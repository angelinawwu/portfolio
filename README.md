# Angelina Wu's Curious Cabinet

Greetings, traveler. If you have stumbled into this repository, you have found the backstage door to the digital menagerie that Angelina Wu curates out in the open at [angelinawwu.com](https://angelinawwu.com).

## What lives in this cabinet?
- A Next.js playground full of gentle hover states, pixel trails, and other friendly experiments.
- Case studies featuring dragons (the friendly ideation kind), data charts, and plenty of work-in-progress coffee.
- A footer that may absolutely have opinions about animation easing curves.

## How to tour the main exhibit
1. Brew your favorite beverage.
2. Open a browser window.
3. Type `angelinawwu.com` into the address bar and press enter with flourish.
4. Bask in the full experience. This repo is just the rehearsal space.

## Feeling extra curious?
If you insist on poking around locally, you can:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

But the whimsical bits are best enjoyed live on the site. Trust the stage lighting.
